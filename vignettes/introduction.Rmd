# Introduction

Glycomics is rapidly emerging field in high-throughput biology that
aims to systematically study glycan structures of a given protein, cell type or
organic system. As within other high-throughput methods in biology (microarrays,
metabolomics, proteomics), accuracy of high-throughput methods is highly affected
by complicated experimental procedures leading to differences between replicates
and the existence of batch effects, among others.

***Glycanr*** package tries to fill the gap in N-glycan data analysis by providing
easy to use functions for glycomics analysis. At the moment it is mostly
oriented to data obtained by UPLC and LCMS analysis of Plasma and IgG
glycome.

## Targeted audience

As commented, the package is currently oriented to data analysts working
with Plasma and IgG glycome data obtained by UPLC and LCMS analysis.
More correctly, it is oriented to the analysts with the data resembling
data from papers like
[Selman et al.][1],
[Pučić et al.][2] or
[Stöckmann et al.][3].

The package helps in calculating different quantities like derived traits
and preparing the data for analysts doing different statistical
or computational modeling of the N-glycan data like in
[Vučković et al.][4], [Krištić et al][5] or
[Barrios et al.][6].

## Working with glycanr package

At the moment glycanr package consists of 12 functions 
and 2 data sets.

Functions  ***glyco.plot*** and ***glyco.outliers*** are handy
functions to quickly explore the data. See the "plots" vignette
for more information.

Functions ***ildt***, ***iudt*** and ***phdt*** return derived traits
obtained from basic glycans. They have a standardized input
depending on the definition of derived traits (e.g. derived
traits as defined in [Huffman et al.][7]). Names of the
columns representing glycans for a specific definition
can be obtained with the argument *print.exp.names*.
Columns of the data frame used to store glycan measurement
should be named according to the expected names. Subset of the
expected names can also be used if some glycans weren't measured.

Functions ***ildt.translate*** and ***iudt.translate*** are
useful to translate between computer friendly and human friendly names.

Functions ***mediannorm***, ***medianquotientnorm***, ***tanorm***,
***refpeaknorm*** and ***quantilenorm*** are used to normalize the data
with specific normalization techniques. See the "normalization" vignette
for more info.

Some functions have a default scheme for column names representing glycans
(e.g. columns starting with "GP" present glycan data) and additional argument
*glyco.names* to change the default.
